// Historical context
export const HISTORICAL_CONTEXT = `
## Sanicle's Evolution and History

Sanicle began in Nigeria as Padman Africa, founded by Chaste Inegbedion. The organization initially focused on grassroots menstrual equity efforts, including:

- Doorstep product delivery reaching over 1M+ women
- Services through urban health centers
- Advocacy that changed national laws, including Nigeria's National Menstrual Health Act (mandating free products in public schools)

In 2021, the organization expanded to the United States and launched Sanicle.cloud, transitioning to a tech-driven workplace wellness platform. This evolution represents the company's growth from direct service to systemic change through technology and enterprise solutions.

The company has received international recognition, hosting the Nova Award at the UN's 69th Commission on the Status of Women and spearheading the Beyond Beijing Summit 30, cementing its role as a policy innovator.

Sanicle is registered as a Community Interest Company (CIC), meaning it prioritizes purpose over profit, channeling 30% of revenue into R&D for low-resource settings.

The company's "Buy One, Donate One" model has matched 1.3 million products across Nigeria, Kenya, and underserved regions in the United States, directly tying business success to social impact.

This history informs Sanicle's unique perspective on menstrual equity, combining grassroots experience with technological innovation and enterprise solutions.

// Problem Statement
export const PROBLEM_STATEMENT = `
## The Problem Sanicle Is Solving

Menstrual and menopause health challenges remain one of the most overlooked issues in today's workforce, despite significant impacts:

- $150 billion annual productivity losses due to menstrual and menopause symptoms in the workplace
- 80% of employees who menstruate experience productivity losses related to their symptoms
- 25% of women consider quitting jobs due to inadequate support for these health issues
- A significant number of employees silently manage menopause symptoms without supportâ€”impacting performance, morale, and retention
- Despite investing heavily in employee wellness, most employers have no data on how hormonal health affects their workforce or bottom line
- Employees face out-of-pocket costs for basic healthcare supplies and insufficient access to tailored resources
- Menstrual and menopause health remains largely overlooked in workplace benefits

This represents not just a health issue but a business issue with real financial consequences. While the women's health technology sector is projected to surpass $50 billion in North America by 2025, a comparable focus on menstrual health in workplace settings has been conspicuously absent.

Sanicle.cloud addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive solution that benefits both employers and employees.
