## Experience

#### Sanicle

#### Senior AI/ML Infrastructure Engineer

```
March 2025 - Present (2 months)
Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States
As Senior AI/ML Infrastructure Engineer at Sanicle, I lead the development of
an AI-powered platform revolutionizing women’s workplace health. I designed
and deployed Sanicle AI (sanicle-ai.vercel.app), a full-stack web app using
Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, integrated with Gemini AI models for
personalized menstrual and menopausal health support.
```
```
Key features include user/HR dashboards, cycle tracking, and resource
management, enhancing employee well-being and productivity. I spearheaded
a scalable architecture with Vercel, Upstash Redis, and Drizzle ORM,
achieving rapid MVP validation. Currently, I’m advancing the AI conversational
agent "Ask Sani" and planning a mobile app, leveraging my full-stack
expertise.

data-driven insights and strategic partnerships, positioning Sanicle as a
