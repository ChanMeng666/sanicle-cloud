# Gabby H PMP. MBA. SSM.

#### Aligning teams to think beyond the screens @ the intersection

#### of empathy and automation. Ecosystem Explorer. Digital Equity

#### Strategist. AI Fluency Advocate.

#### Washington DC-Baltimore Area

## Summary

#### I’m an Ecosystem Explorer — a human API helping people, ideas,

#### and systems connect and thrive across industries.

#### My work is about facilitating harmony at scale — with custom

#### cadence. Because every ecosystem (and every team inside it) needs

#### its own rhythm to grow, adapt, and flow.

#### I move across product, creative, strategy, and people operations

#### — translating complexity into clarity, designing connective

#### infrastructure, and making innovation make sense for the humans

#### inside it.

#### If you’ve ever felt stuck between silos, systems, or roles — you’re

#### not lost. You’re in an ecosystem. And I help you move through it with

#### intention.
