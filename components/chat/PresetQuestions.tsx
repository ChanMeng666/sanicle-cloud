We leverage IBM's WatsonX.ai technology to streamline access to menstrual health resources within the workplace, while empowering HR professionals to provide tailored, data-driven support for employee well-being and productivity.",

  "When will Sanicle.cloud launch?": 
    "According to our most recent roadmap, Sanicle.cloud's MVP beta launch is scheduled for April 2025. The platform has already garnered interest from 80+ enterprise clients and has a waitlist of 1,200+ users. Currently, we're piloting with IBM's 3,000-employee workforce, and moving forward with HIPAA compliance for health data handling. For the most current information on our launch timeline, please reach out to hello@sanicle.us.",

Enhanced data unification and analysis for tailored menstrual health support\n2. Providing deeper insights and support for women's health initiatives\n3.

  "What pricing plans does Sanicle offer?": 
    "Sanicle.cloud offers three main pricing tiers:\n\n**Basic: $10 per month/user**\n- Personalized Cycle Management\n- AI Chatbot - Ask Sani\n- Financial Wellness & Support\n\n**Premium: $15 per month/user**\n- Everything in Basic plus:\n- Educational Resources\n- Social Impact & Employee Rewards\n- Menstrual Syndrome Identification Support\n\n**Enterprise: Custom pricing**\n- Everything in Premium plus:\n- Personalized Training and Consulting\n- Custom Features\n\nFor larger organizations, we also offer employer subscriptions at $10K-50K/year (fixed tiers) and white-label custom solutions for large enterprises ($1K+/month).",

  "Who founded Sanicle?": 
    "Sanicle was founded by Chaste Inegbedion, a social entrepreneur and advocate, who initially launched Padman Africa in Nigeria. In 2021, Sanicle.cloud emerged to address systemic gaps in menstrual healthcare, and by 2024, pivoted to workplace wellness. Chaste is known as \"Mr. Padman\" and is a global leader in femtech, using his expertise in product management and social entrepreneurship to build inclusive, user-friendly solutions and establish key partnerships. Dr. Omopeju Afanu serves as the Chief Executive Officer, bringing her expertise as a passionate advocate for women's health with a user-first, insight-driven approach to product innovation.",

  "What problem is Sanicle trying to solve?": 
    "Sanicle addresses the critical gap in menstrual and menopause health support in workplace benefits. Studies show that 80% of employees who menstruate experience productivity losses related to their symptoms, costing employers $150 billion per year in workplace absenteeism. Despite this:\n\n- 25% of women consider quitting their jobs due to menopause and menstrual health struggles\n- Most employers have no data on how hormonal health affects their workforce\n- Employees face barriers such as out-of-pocket costs for basic healthcare supplies\n- Lack of inclusive policies that address menstrual and menopause care\n- Insufficient access to tailored healthcare resources\n\nDespite the $1.5 trillion self-funded employee health plan industry, menstrual and menopause health remains largely overlooked in workplace benefits, creating both health and business challenges with real financial consequences.",

  "What is the \"Buy One, Donate One\" model?": 
    "Sanicle's \"Buy One, Donate One\" model is a direct tie between product sales and social impact. For every product purchased, Sanicle donates menstrual kits to underserved communities. To date, we've matched 1.3 million products across Nigeria, Kenya, and underserved regions in the United States. This model is part of our broader commitment as a social enterprise that merges profit with purpose, reinvesting 100% of profits into eradicating period poverty and advancing menstrual health policies. The model supports our mission to ensure access to menstrual health education, sustainable products, and inclusive policiesâ€”bridging grassroots impact with global systemic change.",
